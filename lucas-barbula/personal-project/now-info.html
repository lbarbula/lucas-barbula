    <h1>Lucas in the Now</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Lucas. I grew up on a small cattle ranch in northern
        Wyoming. I moved to Denver 2 years ago and really love it. I attended
        University and graduated in 2011 with a degree in Philosophy and
        Environment and Natural Resources. I spend most of my time riding bikes
        and spending time with my girlfriend Leslie.</p>
