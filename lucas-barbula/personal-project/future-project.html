  <body id=future>
    <p id=code>I am really looking forward to continuing with my programming
    education and gSchool for a multitude of reasons. Most importantly
    approaching education from a non-traditional stance allows me to go
    back into the work force more quickly, which is really the only way
    that I can personally justify going back to school. Also, programming
    gives me the opportunity to use my analytical training that I achieved in
    my undergraduate years to make a career pivot into something more impactful
    than cooking food.</p>
